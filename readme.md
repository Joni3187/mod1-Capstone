Read Me Seymore,
This is my submission Portfolio Project for Module 1 
As a student with little to no experience coding and programming,
I would like to submit this project as a reflection of what I have learned during
our first Module with MIT xPRO. I am excited working on this project, adding personalization
and flair!!! Keeping in mind, of course, clean and readable code!

Future thoughts on project:
Additions I am considering for future release...
Would like to embed a music player. (spotify)
a photo gallery of my favorite images.
